The following CSS code uses an invalid selector that can lead to unexpected behavior or rendering issues:

```css
.my-class { /* This is a valid class selector */
  color: blue;
}

.my-class[type="text"] { /* Invalid attribute selector */
  color: red; 
}
```

The issue is that this selector `[type="text"]`  in CSS only works with elements that have inherent `type` attributes.  Using it on elements that don't inherently have a `type` attribute won't work as intended (it may not select anything, or have unintended side-effects).

For instance, this might be applied to `<div>` elements, which don't have `type` attributes, rendering the second rule ineffective.   The correct way to select such elements and set their styles would depend on how those elements are structured in your HTML.
